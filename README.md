# Project22

### **_Introduction_**
This progam gives an overview of the type of turbines in the current campaign. Additionally, it also shows information on each of the turbines and their defects.

### **_Used technologies_**
1. Python
2. Tkinter
3. Pillow

### **_How to run the program_**
This program uses Tkinter and Pillow.
In order to run the program these modules will have to be installed:
    pip install tkinter
    pip install pillow
If you do not yet have pip installed on you computer, you can find it here: https://pypi.org/project/pip/

### **_Future works_**
The logic for this program is fully functional, but can be improved. However, because of time constraints, the GUI and design is not that pretty.
With additional time I would have used Figma in order to make the design more modern and user-friendly with: https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer
